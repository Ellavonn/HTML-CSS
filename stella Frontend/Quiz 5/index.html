		kay so I know what you're thinking, isn't Miami just more beaches and more palm trees? Well yes, but the Biltmore Hotel is a completely different escape of its own. Stepping into the Biltmore Hotel is like being transported into a world of Spanish and Italian luxury with just a hint of Miami. Picture the tropical Floridian environment mixed with the classic Mediterranean architecture. Sounds a little crazy doesn't it? Well, that crazy unique style is exactly what has made the Biltmore hotel so popular since it was named a National Historic Landmark back in 1996. As we drove through Coral Gables towards the hotel, you could already see the famous tower peeking through above the palm trees. It really does make you feel like you are arriving at a castle! All that was missing were my glass slippers and fairygodmother!<<br/>

        Once inside and all checked in it was time to explore! I'm not going to lie, I had seen tons of pictures and videos of the hotels from other bloggers and even some tv shows so it was crazy to be there in person! The hotel was filled with gorgeous details, even the lobby could take one's breath away. But my absolute favorite area was at the center of the hotel. You could walk out the double doors and would find yourself in a two-story courtyard, filled with tropical plants, gorgeous colors, and even parrots flying around. It had an almost Indonesian vibe to it with all of the painted details!
