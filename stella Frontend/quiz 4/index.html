		<h4>THE BEST WAY TO SKIN A CAT</h4>

		<p>‘‘Go with the grain of the hair,’’ says Anthony Eddy, a taxidermist who has worked on house cats, bobcats and mountain lions. The cleanest of the many ways to skin a cat begins with a so-called dorsal cut. Start at the bottom of the skull, and cut a straight line to the base of the tail along the spine. ‘‘Always use a sharp blade,’’ says Eddy, who prefers a carbon steel scalpel. Peel the skin back as you would an orange. Trim carefully around the paws, mouth, nose and eyes. This is obviously not work for the squeamish, but to make a lifelike remembrance of an animal means doing things that make its death inescapable.</p>

    <p>For larger specimens, Eddy opts for traditional taxidermy, pulling the tanned skin over a polyurethane manikin. For house cats, he prefers freeze-drying, which retains the unique characteristics of a pet’s face and involves replacing the internal organs and fat with silicone, then drying the posed body in a machine for up to seven months. ‘‘When a hunter brings in a deer, they just want it to look like a deer,’’ Eddy says. ‘‘Cat owners don’t want a generic cat — they want Fluffy.’’<p/>

    <p>Put any creature you want preserved in the freezer within two hours of its death; rigor mortis sets in as soon as the body cools. ‘‘Bacteria is your enemy,’’ Eddy says. Thawed animals become particularly pliable and easy to skin. If you hope to make a rug or want to freeze-dry, begin with a ventral incision along the underside.<p/><br>

    <p>Last year, about 40 years after he opened his shop in Slater, Mo., Eddy sold the pet-preservation part of his business to his nephew. He no longer wants to answer to emotionally fraught pet owners who demand the transformation of often scrawny, graying cadavers into sleeker, younger ones. He still works on deer heads and wildlife to which people have no particular nostalgic attachments.<p/>
    
     <p> Eddy says, ‘‘when someone asks for a smiling cat, what does that even mean?’’<p/>
